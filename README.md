# React-Calculator
A normal button clicked or typed calculator. Performs  Addition, Subtraction ,Multiplication and Division.

So this is basically JavaSripts files which should be added to ur react app folder in src folder.
after adding

#type#
cd (web name)
npm start
#type#

After this you will be opened to the developer option and can view the calculator which is completely made with React.
Includes CSS styles.
